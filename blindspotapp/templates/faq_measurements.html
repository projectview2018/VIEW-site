		The volume of interest is the volume around the vehicle extending 15 feet forward from the front of the hood, 15 feet from the side from the vehicle's passenger side, and 74 inches high.
		The volume extending from the driver side is not measured. Outside of the A-pillar blind zones, crash data has shown that crashes in the driver-side blind zone are less common than crashes in the
		front and passenger-side blind zones.

		<p><p>The distance from the front and passenger sides are taken from TfL's research. The height limit of 74 inches, or 6 feet and 2 inches, corresponds to the 95th percentile height of men in the US,
		thereby ensuring our volume of interest captures as many types of VRUs as possible.
