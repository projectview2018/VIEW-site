		The volume of interest is the volume around the vehicle extending fifteen feet forward from the end of the hood, fifteen feet from the side from the passenger side of the vehicle, and 74 inches high.
		The volume extending from the driver side is not measured. Crash data has shown that crash risks from driver side blindzones are minimal compared to the other sides.
